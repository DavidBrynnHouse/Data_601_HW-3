## Overview

---

The data set that I chose to work with was a labeled set of emails inorder to create a spam classifier. The dataset contains 4602 entries with 58 features, there are no missing values. 

## Goals

The main goal of this project was to create a spam filter that can label incoming emails as spam or not spam. Secondary goals were to determine which algorithm most effectively labeled emails and to demonstrate model selection of classification algorithms.


## Motivation and Background

The motivation for this project was to recreate a spam filter based on data collected from the Kaggle website. By doing this I hoped to learn more about how to create classification algorithms with sklearn and python. This type of work is important because spam emails can be annoying and even malicious. By creating an algorithm to label data as spam we can limit the number of spam emails that an individual receives.


## Requirements

---

The software used in this analysis included:

1) Python
2) Pandas package for python
3) sklearn package for python
